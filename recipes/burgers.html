    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Absolutely amazing, added egg yolk to keep meat together and maybe added 
        a little too much onion but definitely keeping this one in the books</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup beer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Mix the ground beef, onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix in the beer until absorbed by the meat mixture. Form into patties.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
